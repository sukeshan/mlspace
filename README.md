A personal portfolio website featuring a "Glassmorphism" design, blog clustering, and interactive elements.

## How to Run Locally

You can run this website locally using a simple HTTP server. Here are a few ways to do it:

### Option 1: Using Python (Recommended)
If you have Python 3 installed (which is standard on macOS):

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/apple/nilla/mee
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Option 2: Using Node.js
If you prefer Node.js:

1. Open your terminal in the project directory.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```
3. It will show you the URL to open (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

### Option 3: Direct File Open
You can also simply double-click the `index.html` file in your file explorer to open it in your browser. Note that some features might behave slightly differently than on a real server.
